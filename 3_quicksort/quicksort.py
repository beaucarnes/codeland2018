Project 3: Quicksort
---

Now it's time to improve the sort algorithm! Implement the sort function in 'quicsort.py' using quicksort. The
function should sort the people array from 'contactapp.py'. The algorithm should sort by 'name' or 'age',
depending on what is passed in. To check, run 'contactapp.py' and verify that when you print contacts,
the program accurately sorts the list based on the given parameter.

Note: The quicksort function should return a new sorted list instead of modifying the list passed in.
